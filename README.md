# Mat file loader for ImageJ/Fiji

## Installation

Download the files `matfilerw.jar` and `openmat_.jar` from the `Assets` section in the recent [release](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/OpenMAT/releases).
Copy `matfilerw.jar` to the `jars` subdirectory of your Fiji installation and `openmat_.jar` to the `Plugins` subdirectory of Fiji.

## Usage

Click the menu File > Open > Mat to open your matlab mat files.

## Info

This plugin is knitted around the [matfilerw](https://github.com/diffplug/matfilerw) library.

It is in experimental stage and I would be happy about user feedback. Drop me a line (rhaase at mpi-cbg.de) if you want to support its development - either by providing feedback or by coding :-)
